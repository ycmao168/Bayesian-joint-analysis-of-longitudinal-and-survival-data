There are three R files, "sampledata.RData", "Analysis.R", and "Supportfunctions.R" in addition to this readme file.

The file "sampledata.RData" is an R workspace, containing a 1966*5 matrix (named "longitudinal") for the longitudinal data and a 500*5 matrix (named "survival") for the survival data from 500 subjects.

The file "Analysis.R" provides an illustrative example for analyzing the sample data, including parameter estimation and creating tables and figures.

The file "Supportfunctions.R" contains all of the support functions for data analysis.
